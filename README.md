📖 Learning Outcomes

Through this project I practiced:

- Structuring a React + TypeScript project with modular architecture

- Writing typed props & interfaces for components

- Managing feature branches with conventional commits and pull requests

- Building responsive layouts with Tailwind

- Following a real-world Git workflow (feature branches → PR → merge → delete)

🔮 Future Improvements

- Add smooth animations with Framer Motion

- Connect Contact Form to a backend (e.g., Node.js / Firebase)

- Integrate a CMS (Sanity / Contentful) for dynamic content

- Add unit tests with Jest + React Testing Library
